## How the expense tracker works

How the Expense Tracker App Works
The Expense Tracker app helps users manage their expenses. Here's a quick overview of its features:

Add Expenses: Users can input expense details such as name, description, amount, category, and date. When the form is submitted, the expense is added to the list.

View Expenses: All expenses are displayed in a table with columns for Expense, Description, Amount, Category, and Date.

Search Expenses: A search bar allows users to filter expenses by name or description.

Delete Expenses: Each expense has a Delete button that removes it from the list when clicked.

The app uses React state to manage expenses, form inputs, and search functionality. The user interface is simple, with a clean black-and-white theme. The list updates automatically as users add or delete expenses.
